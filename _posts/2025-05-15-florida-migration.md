# Introduction

Understanding spatial inequality requires more than examining socioeconomic indicators in isolation. This project explores how migration-based community structures in Florida relate to racial composition and educational attainment. 
Using county-to-county migration data and US Census statistics, this blog explains how I applied Louvain community detection and visualized educational and racial disparities across communities.
