# Introduction

Understanding spatial inequality requires more than examining socioeconomic indicators in isolation. This project explores how migration-based community structures in Florida relate to racial composition and educational attainment. 
Using county-to-county migration data and US Census statistics, this blog explains how I applied Louvain community detection and visualized educational and racial disparities across communities.

# Data and Preprocessing
## Data used
- **Migration Data**: US Census Bureau's 2016-2020 county-to-county migration flows for Florida.
- **Demographic Data**: ACS-derived variables on race, income, education, commute time, etc.

After filtering for intra-Florida migration, I built a directed weighted network and mapping visualizations, joined node-level attributes, retaining key variables such as:
- ``median_income``
- ``share_white``, ``share_african``, ``share_asian``, ``share_alaska``, ``share_hawai`` (racial proportions)
- ``share_bachelor``, ``share_master``, etc. (educational attainment)
