# What is Data Mining?
Data mining is a technology that blends traditional data analysis methods with sophisticated algorithms for processing large volumes of data. 
This is a process of extracting implicit, unknown and potentially meaningful information from data. 
Exploration & Analysis, by automatic or semi-automatic means, large quantities of data to discover meaningful patterns. 

# Tasks and features of Data mining
1)	Prediction Methods
-	Mainly for prediction. Learn from some variables, then predict unknown or future values of other variables.
-	X -> y
2)	Description Methods
-	Find human-interpretable patterns that describe the data
-	Regression, correlation, and graphs

Supervised learning – prediction of given target variable using other features of the dataset.

1)	Regression problems 
Target: Continuous/ Numeric variables
Example of Regression 
-	Multivariate regression

2)	Classification problems
Target: Categorical variables
Examples of Classification
-	Logistic Regression
-	Decision tree
-	Rule-based
-	Ensemble
-	Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
-	Support Vector Machine

Unsupervised learning – a set of statistical tools to better understand and describe the data, but performs the analysis without a target variable

1)	Association analysis
Finding relationships between categorical variables 
Examples of Association analysis
-	‘Apriori’ Algorithm

2)	Dimension reduction
Grouping by columns
-	Principal Components Analysis

3)	Clustering
Grouping by rows
-	K-means clustering
-	Hierarchical clustering
-	DBSCAN
-	Graph-based clustering
